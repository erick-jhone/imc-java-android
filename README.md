This project aims to introduce the fundamental concepts of screen navigation in native Android development (Java with XML).

It is for educational purposes only, as it was created for an Introduction to Android activity at the University. Therefore, the separation of responsibilities between classes does not follow any specific pattern or recommendation, and is not applicable in production projects with commercial purposes.
